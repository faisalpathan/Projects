<h3>About events in programming languages</h3>
<p>
	Many programming languages supports events or notifications. The basic concept is that you can
	subscribe to these events and the application will send you a notification or run some code
	when they accour, so you will have a chance to do something you may want to be done in certain
	points of your program. For example change the site's background when the slider switching slides.
</p>

<h3>Javascript uses callback functions</h3>
<p>
	In Javascript these events commonly used with callback functions. Instead of sending and receiving
	notifications, you just pass an anonymous function (also known as blocks in other languages)
	with your own code to a function or method call as a parameter and the application will execute
	it when the time has come. Cute Slider uses this kind of event handling.
</p>

<h3>Events in Cute Slider</h3>
<p>
	So we now by now the technique about event handling, lets see which kind of event Cute Slider has:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Cute.SliderEvent.CHANGE_START:</strong>
		This event will fire when Cute Slider starting to change slides.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Cute.SliderEvent.CHANGE_END:</strong>
		Calling when Cute Slider finished a slide change.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Cute.SliderEvent.WATING:</strong>
		Dispatches as long as slider is standing in one slide.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Cute.SliderEvent.CHANGE_NEXT_SLIDE:</strong>
		The slider will call this function when the next slide of slider changes.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Cute.SliderEvent.WATING_FOR_NEXT:</strong>
		Dispatches until slider is waiting for next slide loading.
	</li>
</ul>


<h3>A simple example of a callback function</h3>
<p>
	This simple example will alert the user when Cute Slider changed a slide. To do that we
	have to pass this function to the <i>Cute.SliderEvent.CHANGE_END</i> event.
</p>
<pre>function() {
	alert('The slider switched to a new slide!');
}</pre>
